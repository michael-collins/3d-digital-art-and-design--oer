##Welcome
###Warning:

**We have a ton of material to cover this semester.** To do well in this class, you have to work really hard, so make sure you are prepared to commit to a rigorous work ethic! You will lose sleep this semester, but it will be fun!

##What is this class about?

This is an __**art**__ class where we use indistry standard design tools.

Theme prompts require that you will take novel and creative approaches to visual and conceptual investigations. Your ability to be a creative problem solver is more important than your ability to model or texture.

Can I make game environments, characters, short films, etc?
Yes. The projects in this class support your individual creative interests. How you solve for the project themes are up to you, as long as they are within the constraints of the project, and projects are fairly open ended. Never do something just because you’ll think that I’ll like it. Take ownership of your work.

- Be in class on time
- Read the attendance policy, it’s not joking
- Meet deadlines (missed proj milestones will will not be graded). The highest grade for a late exercise is a C.

- Be a self learner, but don’t be afraid to ask questions
  - 15 Miniute rule: Try to answer your own question. If it's taking more than 15 minutes, ask for help!
- Please be respectful to your peers who are working diligently by not distracting them with cat videos or other sources of entertainment.
- Contribute during critiques

##Technology sucks!
- Rule #1: Never trust technology
  - Plan Ahead by doing the following:
  - Turn on Autosave
  - Always have a backup (the computer lab machine doesn't count)
  - Make sure your backups are synced
  - The computer lab computers get wiped every few days
  - Allow enough time to render your project twice because:
    - You will make mistakes
    - You have a chance to improve work
  - Save multiple scene files at different stages (iteratively) because Maya will:
    - Crash and corrupt your **one and only** file
    - Crash before you had a chance to save
