[Level 1 Steps](#level-1) | [Level 2 Steps](#level-2) | [Level 3 Steps](#level-3)

### <a name="level-1"></a>Level 1:

1. Watch tutorials from Lynda on modeling with Polygons and Nurbs.
2. Download [these project files](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzXX6rmROMNWandfd3hKLXRCdmM/edit) and use the scene file as the starting point and rename the project folder to : **_{{ page.submission-id }}_**.
3. Set your project to the downloaded folder by choosing **File** → **Set Project**.
4. Create an abstracted composition using dispalcement, explosion, and polygon reduction 
5. Save your scene as **_{{ page.submission-id }}_** in the scenes folder.
6. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_{{ page.submission-id }}-L1.zip._**
7. Upload the .zip file to the [submission dropbox]({{ page.assignment-dropbox }})
8. Ensure you’ve included everything properly. Failure to ensure that you’ve uploaded the file will result in your exercise being graded according the grading criteria.
